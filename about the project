1. TITLE
Simulation of a Satellite-Based Disaster Response Network Using STK
(Satellite Tool Kit)
2. ABSTRACT
This project investigates the simulation of a Satellite-Based Disaster
Response Network using the Satellite Tool Kit (STK) to reestablish
communication in regions affected by natural disasters where terrestrial
networks are compromised. The simulation creates a realistic
framework for deploying satellites to provide essential communication
channels, which are critical for effective disaster management and
coordination of relief efforts. Key steps include setting up satellite
configurations, establishing ground stations, creating communication
links, and analyzing performance metrics like signal strength, latency,
and coverage. The resulting simulation serves as a powerful model for
illustrating how satellite networks can support disaster response,
offering a robust communication solution when conventional
infrastructure fails.
3. PROBLEM DEFINITION
Natural disasters often devastate terrestrial communication
infrastructure, isolating affected areas and hindering rescue and
recovery operations. In such cases, establishing reliable communication
becomes paramount for effective disaster response. This project aims to
address the issue by simulating a satellite-based communication
network that can provide a quick and dependable alternative to
terrestrial networks. Using STK, the project models the deployment of
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites to enable resilient communication links
between disaster zones and response centers, ensuring continuous
information flow critical for saving lives and coordinating relief.
4. RATIONALE OF THE PROBLEM
Traditional communication networks, including cell towers and wired
connections, are highly vulnerable to physical damage during disasters
such as earthquakes, tsunamis, or hurricanes. The loss of
communication exacerbates the crisis, making it challenging for
authorities to assess needs, allocate resources, and coordinate
responses. Satellite networks, particularly those with LEO
constellations, offer a reliable alternative by providing coverage from
space, unaffected by ground-level disruptions. Simulating this scenario
with STK enables a detailed analysis of satellite-based communication
networks’ role in disaster recovery, demonstrating how they can fill
critical communication gaps and support efficient disaster management.
5. OBJECTIVES
○ To simulate a disaster response scenario using STK, where
satellite-based communication replaces traditional networks in
affected areas.
○ To model satellite configurations, such as orbit types and satellite
constellations, suitable for rapid communication response.
○ To configure and simulate ground stations in disaster zones and
response centers, enabling effective coordination.
○ To establish and analyze communication links between satellites
and ground stations, evaluating key metrics like signal strength,
latency, and coverage.
○ To visualize the impact of satellite networks on disaster
management, assess how they facilitate communication and
assist relief efforts.
