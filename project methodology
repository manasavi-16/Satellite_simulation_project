The following methodology outlines the steps taken to simulate a
satellite-based communication network using MATLAB's Satellite
Tool Kit (STK). This simulation aims to establish reliable
communication during disaster scenarios, particularly when
terrestrial networks are compromised.
1. Objective:
● Develop a system to provide continuous and dependable
communication during disaster events by leveraging satellite
networks when terrestrial systems are disrupted.
2. Satellite Selection:
● LEO Satellite Selection: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites,
such as those in the Iridium constellation, are chosen for their
low latency and global coverage. Their low altitude ensures
faster communication and reduced latency.
● Orbit Design: Optimize parameters like inclination and
altitude to maximize surface coverage, minimize latency, and
enhance communication efficiency between satellites and
ground stations.
3. Ground Station Deployment:
● Strategic Placement: Ground stations are strategically located
in disaster-prone regions and emergency response centers to
maintain reliable communication in affected areas.
● Antenna Configuration: Employ high-gain antennas at
ground stations to ensure strong and reliable signals, even in
adverse conditions such as challenging terrain or severe
weather.
4. Communication Link Setup:
● Frequency Band Allocation: Assign appropriate frequency
bands for uplink and downlink communications to prevent
interference and support optimal data transmission.
● Data Rate Optimization: Configure data rates to
accommodate high-quality communication, including voice,
video, and multimedia, addressing the needs of disaster
responders and affected communities.
● Link Budget Analysis: Calculate and optimize the link budget
to achieve a reliable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for consistent
communication.
5. Performance Evaluation:
● Monitor metrics such as FSPL, Rain attenuation, link margin,
and coverage area. These parameters will be assessed under
various disaster scenarios, including different terrains and
weather conditions, to evaluate network performance.
● Parameter Optimization: Refine satellite orbital parameters,
ground station locations, and communication link
configurations based on performance results to enhance
reliability.
6. Simulation and Testing:
● STK Simulation: Use the Satellite Tool Kit (STK) to simulate
the satellite network, visualize satellite movements, and
analyze communication links under different disaster
conditions.
● Scenario Testing: Conduct tests under various disaster
scenarios (e.g., floods, earthquakes) to verify the network’s
capability in real-world disaster recovery efforts.
